As a storage running a full history mode will not store all the ledger state but keeps all the blocks (and operations), it is the only mode that can be reconstructed. The operation consist of two major steps:</p><ul><li>Reconstructing the cemented block store: for each cemented cycle, the context of each block along with their associated metadatas are restored.</li><li>Reconstructing the floating block stores: this step is only necessary if the store was recently imported from a snapshot as some metadata will be missing.</li></ul><p>As the reconstruction procedure changes the state of the storage, it cannot be run while a node is running on the storage to reconstruct. If the reconstruction is interrupted, it will be resumed if restarted.</p></header><div class="odoc-content"></div></body></html>
