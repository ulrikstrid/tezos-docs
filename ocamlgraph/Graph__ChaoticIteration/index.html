The way to determine, at each step, the next vertex to analyse is called a <em>chaotic iteration strategy</em>. A good strategy can make the analysis much faster. To enforce the termination of the analyse and speed it up when it terminates in too many steps, one can also use a <em>widening</em>, to ensure that there is no infinite (nor too big) sequence of intermediary results for a given vertex. However, it usually results in a loss of precision, which is why choosing a good widening set (the set of points on which the widening will be performed) is mandatory.</p><p>This module computes a fixpoint over a graph using weak topological ordering, which can be used to get both the iteration strategy and the widening set. The module <code>WeakTopological</code> aims to compute weak topological orderings which are known to be excellent decompositions w.r.t these two critical points.</p><dl><dt>author</dt><dd>Thibault Suzanne</dd></dl><dl><dt>see Efficient chaotic iteration strategies with widenings</dt><dd><p>, François Bourdoncle, Formal Methods in Programming and their Applications, Springer Berlin Heidelberg, 1993</p></dd></dl></header><div class="odoc-content"></div></body></html>
