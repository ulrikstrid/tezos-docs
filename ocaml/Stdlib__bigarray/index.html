(Normal float arrays are limited to 2,097,151 elements on a 32-bit platform, and normal arrays of other types to 4,194,303 elements.)</li><li>Bigarrays are multi-dimensional. Any number of dimensions between 0 and 16 is supported. In contrast, OCaml arrays are mono-dimensional and require encoding multi-dimensional arrays as arrays of arrays.</li><li>Bigarrays can only contain integers and floating-point numbers, while OCaml arrays can contain arbitrary OCaml data types.</li><li>Bigarrays provide more space-efficient storage of integer and floating-point elements than normal OCaml arrays, in particular because they support 'small' types such as single-precision floats and 8 and 16-bit integers, in addition to the standard OCaml types of double-precision floats and 32 and 64-bit integers.</li><li>The memory layout of Bigarrays is entirely compatible with that of arrays in C and Fortran, allowing large arrays to be passed back and forth between OCaml code and C / Fortran code with no data copying at all.</li><li>Bigarrays support interesting high-level operations that normal arrays do not provide efficiently, such as extracting sub-arrays and 'slicing' a multi-dimensional array along certain dimensions, all without any copying.</li></ul><p>Users of this module are encouraged to do <code>open Bigarray</code> in their source, then refer to array types and operations via short dot notation, e.g. <code>Array1.t</code> or <code>Array2.sub</code>.</p><p>Bigarrays support all the OCaml ad-hoc polymorphic operations:</p><ul><li>comparisons (<code>=</code>, <code>&lt;&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;=</code>, etc, as well as <a href="../Stdlib/index.html#val-compare"><code>Stdlib.compare</code></a>);</li><li>hashing (module <code>Hash</code>);</li><li>and structured input-output (the functions from the <code>Marshal</code> module, as well as <a href="../Stdlib/index.html#val-output_value"><code>Stdlib.output_value</code></a> and <a href="../Stdlib/index.html#val-input_value"><code>Stdlib.input_value</code></a>).</li></ul></header><div class="odoc-content"></div></body></html>
