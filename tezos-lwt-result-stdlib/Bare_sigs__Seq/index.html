These functions traverse the elements sequentially: the promise for a given step of the traversal is only initiated when the promise for the previous step is resolved.

These functions traverse the elements concurrently: the promise for all the steps are created immediately. The suffix <code>_p</code> is chosen for similarity with the <a href="../../lwt/Lwt_list/index.html"><code>Lwt_list</code></a> functions even though, as with <a href="../../lwt/Lwt_list/index.html"><code>Lwt_list</code></a>'s functions there is no parallelism involved, only concurrency. Note that these functions have a “best-effort” behaviour: the whole-traversal promise (i.e., the promise returned by the <code>_p</code>-suffixed function) only resolves once each of the step promises have resolved. Even if one of the step promise is rejected, the whole-traversal promise is only rejected once all the other step promises have resolved.</p><p>All the traversal functions that are suffixed with <code>_es</code> are within the combined error-and-Lwt monad. These function traverse the elements sequentially with a fail-early behaviour for both rejection (as an Lwt promise) and failure (as a result).</p><p>All the traversal functions that are suffixed with <code>_ep</code> are within the combined error-and-Lwt monad. These function traverse the elements concurrently with a best-effort behaviour.</p></header><div class="odoc-content"></div></body></html>
